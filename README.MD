<h1 align="center">How to set up custom Discord Rich Presence using EasyRP</h1>
<h3 align="center"> You need to download EasyRP first (either from the official repo or my files here already consist of the same)</h3>

- ⭐ Go to Discord Dev portal & create a new application.
- ⭐ Keep in mind that your application name = the Rich Presence Name ( Here in this example, I used "Netflix" as the application name)
- ⭐ Once you save that, go to the Rich presence option under that and select "Art Asset" and upload the 2 images you want to use. ( One is the main image and one is the small one, here the
Netflix Logo is the main image & the play icon is the small image).

- I would suggest you to name then "Large_Image" and "Small_image" respectively ( though its up to you!)

- ⭐ Now save that and copy the Client ID from the application and then go to the EasyRP folder. ( You will see 3 files, including an "config.ini" file)

- ⭐ Open the congif.ini file using notepad or any editor and set the values accordingly (Refer to the config.ini) file I provided to see what all to fill.

- ⭐ Once done, save it and run the "easyrp.exe", and then vola! You can see the RP on your profile! 


According to my files privided here, the discord RP would look like this -

I just used the Netflix theme as an example here, you can change it into anything you like! Hope it helps



P.s - The files in this repo are my customised EasyRP files.
